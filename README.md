# Static site generator for Simple Knowledge Management Systems (SKOS)

This part of the [SkoHub](http://skohub.io) project covers the need to easily publish a controlled vocabulary as a SKOS file, with a basic lookup API and a nice HTML view including links to an inbox for each subject. It consists of two parts: the actual static site generator and a webhook server that allows to trigger a build from GitHub. For usage & implementation details see the [blog post](https://blog.lobid.org/2019/09/27/presenting-skohub-vocabs.html).

## Set up

    $ git clone https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-vocabs.git
    $ cd skohub-vocabs
    $ npm i
    $ cp .env.example .env
    $ cp test/data/systematik.ttl data/

The `.env` file contains configuration details used by the static site generator and the webhook server (like `PORT`, see below).

After changes to your `.env` or `data/*` files, make sure to delete the `.cache` directory:

    $ rm -rf .cache

## Running the static site generator

The static site generator will parse all turtle files in `./data` and build the vocabularies it finds:

    $ npm run build

The build can be found in `public/` and be served e.g. by Apache. The directory structure is derived from the URIs of the SKOS concepts, e.g. `https://w3id.org/class/hochschulfaecher/scheme` will be available from `public/w3id.org/class/hochschulfaecher/scheme(.html|.json)`.

You can also run the development web server:

    $ npm run develop

to serve the build from `http://localhost:8000/`. Again, the URL is based on the SKOS URIs, e.g. `http://localhost:8000/w3id.org/class/hochschulfaecher/scheme.html`

## Running the webhook server

The webhook server allows to trigger a build when vocabularies are updated (i.e. changes are merged into the `master` branch) on GitHub.

Running `npm run listen` will start the server on the defined `PORT` and expose a `build` endpoint. In order to wire this up with GitHub, this has to be available to the public. You can then configure the webhook in your GitHub repositories settings:

## Connecting to our webhook server

Feel free to clone https://github.com/literarymachine/skos.git to poke around. Go to https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/skos/settings/hooks/new to set up the web hook (get in touch to receive the secret). Edit https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/skos/edit/master/hochschulfaecher.ttl and commit the changes to master. This will trigger a build and expose it at https://test.skohub.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/skos/w3id.org/class/hochschulfaecher/scheme.

## Use start scripts and monit

You may want to use the start scripts in `scripts/` to manage via init and to monitor with `monit`.

## Troubleshooting

Depending on special circumstances you may get errors in the log files, e.g.
`EMFILE: too many open files`. [Search our issues for solutions](https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-vocabs/issues?q=is%3Aissue) or feel encouraged to open a new issue if you can't find a solution.

## Credits

The project to create a stable beta version of SkoHub has been funded by the North-Rhine Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz) and carried out in cooperation with [graphthinking GmbH](https://graphthinking.com/) in 2019/2020.
